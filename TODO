Important (before launch)
-------------------------
- Change license to LGPL
- Remove references to obsidian
- Add a setup.py script to install the package automatically
- Upload library to pip so we can pip install

Not important
-------------
- Tuning guide for adapters + different settings for different scenarios
- Add demo for recovery
- Documentation update for C++
- The C++ stats::Mixture<> is not numerically stable (log of sum of exps)
- Improve performance by switching modulo '%' with a 'countdown' e.g.
  if (length % adapt_interval == 0) {
     // adapt
  }

  vs.

  if (length == next_adapt) {
    // adapt
    next_adapt += adapt_interval
  }

  or

  if (--next_adapt == 0) {
    // adapt
    next_adapt = adapt_interval
  }

- Do we need to store the sigmas/betas for every state in the database?
  Could save space by only storing the current sigma/beta for each chain.
- Need to be able to recover adapter state (e.g. recover the covariance etc.?)
- Possible comparisons with other MCMC libraries (PyMC, emcee, BUGS)
- Add shell script to run the demo and worker at the same time, so there's no
  need to manually launch worker to see the demos
- Check if there's any unused settings structs in C++

##Introduction

Stateline is a framework for distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling written in C++. It implements [parallel tempering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_tempering) and factorising likelihoods, in order to exploit parallelisation and distribution computing resources.

Stateline is composed of a server that samples from a given parameter space, and a set of workers that are directed by the server to evaluate a user's likelihood function. These workers can run on the same machine or communicate over the network as part of a distributed cluster. Stateline has workers implemented in C++ and Python, for which the user need only define their likelihood function. Building a worker in another language is simple as long as it has bindings for ZeroMQ.


###Why Stateline

insert text here about when one might use stateline rather than say stan.

###MCMC Sampling

MCMC is a widely used algorithm for sampling from a probability distribution given only its unnormalised posterior density. Consequently, MCMC provides a general solution to a wide class of Bayesian inference problems prevalent in scientific research. Stateline provides an MCMC solution for problems with difficult posteriors that may be highly non-Gaussian and for difficult likelihoods where the observation models are highly non-linear, expensive ‚Äòblack box‚Äô functions such as numerical simulations. Stateline will distribute the computation of these likelihoods over a cluster, and uses parallel tempering to handle the case that the structure of the posterior distribution itself may be multi-modal. 

#### Metropolis Hastings

An effective algorithm to sample in high dimensions is a random-walk Markov chain, which uses the current state of a chain of samples to propose a new state. The proposal is usually a simple distribution g, such as a Gaussian centered on the current state. This allows the algorithm to exploit the structure of the posterior - if we propose a state similar to the last draw, then it is likely to be accepted. With a well designed proposal scheme, an efficient acceptance rate can be achieved even in high dimensions. This comes at the cost of sample correlation, because the draws are no longer independent. To actually achieve independent draws from the posterior requires taking multiple Markov steps. The simplest form of random-walk MCMC is the Metropolis Hastings algorithm, which accepts a step from x to x‚Äô with probability A:

    <img src="docs/images/mh_accept.png" height="40">
</p>

Here, P is the (unnormalised) target density and g is the density of the proposal function for a transition from x to x‚Äô. Through detailed balance, the resulting draws have the same equilibrium distribution as the target distribution.


#### Proposal Distributions

The design objective of a proposal distribution is to maximise the number of proposals required per independent sample from the posterior. A conservative proposal that takes small steps may have a high acceptance rate, but will produce a highly autocorrelated chain. Conversely, a broad proposal that attempts large steps will suffer from a low acceptance rate. Studies in the literature have shown that a convergence 'sweet spot' exists, for example an accept rate of 0.234 is optimal if the likelihood is a separable function of each component of a high dimensional parameter space Œ∏ [Roberts97].  

Because the optimal proposal distribution depends strongly on the target posterior, it is important for an MCMC tool to provide an automatic adaption mechanism. Care must be taken because naive adaptation of the proposal during sampling may invalidate the ergodicity of the MCMC chain, causing the resulting samples to be drawn from a different distribution. The simplest sufficient condition to guarantee correctness is the diminishing adaptation principle [Roberts05]. Stateline learns a proposal scale factor that that, together with the empirical covariance of the samples, forms a diminishing adaptation proposal function [Andrieu2008]. 

#### Parallel Tempering

Even with a well tuned proposal distribution, MCMC chains tend to become trapped in local modes of the target distribution. A distribution that highlights this problem is the double-well potential below. A proposal that can jump between the modes in one step is too coarse to effectively explore the individual modes, while the probability of accepting an intermediate state between them is almost zero. Thus a standard MCMC approach would explore a single mode and have no knowledge of the other:

<p align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/double_well.png" width="500">
    <p>
    Figure: (Left) A double-potential well target distribution is a challenging problem for MCMC sampling. (Right) The same distribution raised to the ‚Öõ power is much easier to sample because the modes are bridged.
</p>

On the other hand, the modes on the right distribution are bridged so a markov chain would be able to mix between them effectively. Parallel tempering (Metropolis-Coupled Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo) exploits this concept by constructing multiple chains, one exploring the base distribution, and the others at increasingly higher ‚Äòtemperatures‚Äô. The high temperature chains see a distribution equivalent to the original density raised to a fractional power, bringing the distribution closer to uniform (the distribution on the right had a temperature of 8 times the one on the left). The acceptance criterion is therefore modified to take into account temperature T:

<p align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/pt_accept.png" height="40">
</p>

Now the high temperature chains exchange information by proposing exchanges of state (the exchanges are themselves a markov chain), with the probability given by:

<p align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/pt_swap.png" height="70">
</p>

Here Ti is the temperature of the i‚Äôth temperature chain, ùõ∑ is the target density and Œ∏i is the state of chain i.


#### Convergence Heuristics

Chain convergence can be inferred by independently running multiple MCMC chains (stacks) and comparing their statistical measures. If the chains are exploring a different set of modes, this can be detected. Otherwise we must assume they are adequately mixing, although there is a possibility that all the chains have failed to discover a mode (parallel tempering reduces the probability of this happening). Stateline employs the approach of [Brooks98]. 

##System Requirements

Stateline has been sucsessfully compiled on Linux and OSX machines. We don't currently support Windows. For large-scale deployments, we recommend using Docker (and the dockerfile included in this repo).

To build stateline, you will need the following:

* GCC 4.8.2/Clang 6.0+
* CMake 3.0+
* zlib 

Stateline will automatically download and build the other prerequisite libraries in requires. However, if you would like to use
operating system or other copies, you will also need:

* Boost 1.59+
* Eigen 3.2.0+
* google-test 1.7.0+
* zeromq 4.0+

To run the python demos, you will also need:

* Python 2.7/3.4+
* Pyzmq
* numpy
* corner-plot (python library)

##Installation

First clone the repository and enter the directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NICTA/stateline.git
$ cd stateline 
```

The simplest way to build Stateline is to use the `fetch-deps` script that will automatically download and build the dependencies required. By default, it will dowload them into a `prereqs` subdirectory of the stateline repository. It will also create a build subdirectory for the stateline binaries.

```bash
$ ./tools/fetch-deps
```

If you would like to specify the build and prereq directories manually, you can:

```bash
$ export BUILD_DIR=<my build dir>
$ export PREREQ_DIR=<my prereq dir>
$ ./tools/fetch-deps
```

Next, run the configure script which will point cmake to correct prereq and build directories:

```bash
$ ./tools/configure release
```

Substitute `release` with `debug` or `relwithdebinfo` if you would prefer these build types.
You should only need to run this configure script once (even if you are developing stateline itself). From then on, just run make from your build directory:

```bash
$ cd build
$ make
```

If you would like to install stateline, run
```bash
$ make install
```

which will output headers, libraries and binaries into an `install` subdirectory of the build directory. From there you may copy them to the appropriate folders in your operating system.

##Getting Started

###Configuration

Stateline is configured through a json file. An example file is given below:

```json
{
"nJobTypes": 3,
"nStacks": 2,
"nTemperatures": 5,
"nSamplesTotal": 60000,

"min": [-10, 0, -10, -10],
"max": [ 10, 10, 10, 2],


"swapInterval": 10,
"optimalAcceptRate": 0.234,
"optimalSwapRate": 0.3874,

"outputPath": "demo-output",
"loggingRateSec": 1,
}
```
`nJobTypes`: The number of terms that the likelihood factorises into. In other words, if `nJobTypes` = 10, each evaluation of the likelihood for a state will be separated into 10 jobs, that state along with the job index 1-10 will sent to the workers for evaluation, and the resulting log-likelihoods from each worker will be summed into a single value for that state. This corresponds to a factorizing likelihood with 10 terms.

`nStacks`: The number of totally separate sets of chains run simultaineously. Stateline runs 'stacks' of chains at different temperatures that swap states as part of parallel tempering. However, one good way to test for convergence is to run additonal stacks that are separately initialised (and that do not swap with eachother), then look at how similiar the statistics of each stack are. Multiple stacks is also another way to utilize additional computing resources to get more samples more quickly as they are evaluated in parallel by stateline workers.

`nTemperaturesTotal`: The number of chains in a single parallel tempering stack. The temperatures of these chains are automatically determined. More complex and higher-dimensional likelihoods will need more chains in each stack. See the tips and tricks section for how to estimate a reasonable value.

`nSamplesTotal`: The total number of samples *from all stacks* that will be sampled before the program ends. There is no automatic decimation or burn-in at the moment -- these are raw samples straight from the sampler so be sure to take that into account.

`min`: Stateline requires hard bounds to be set on the parameter space. This is the minimum bound. Feel free to set this to all zeros and transform inside your likelihood if you prefer.

`max`: Stateline requires hard bounds to be set on the parameter space. This is the maximum bound. Feel free to set this to all ones and transform inside your likelihood if you prefer.

`swapInterval`: The number of states evaluated before the chains in a stack attempt a pairwise swap from hottest to coldest. A larger value is more computationally efficient, whilst a smaller value will produce better mixing of states between chains of different temperatures.

`optimalAcceptRate`: The adaption mechanism in stateline will scale the Metropolis Hastings proposal distribution to attempt to hit this acceptance rate for each chain. 0.5 is theoretically optimal for a 1D Gaussian. 0.234 is the limit for a Gaussian as dimensionality goes to infinity... from there you're on your own (we usually use 0.234).

`optimalSwapRate`: The adaption mechanism in stateline will change the temperatures of adjacent chains in a stack to attempt to hit this swap rate. A reasonable heuristic is to set it equal to the optimal accept rate.

`ouputpath`: The directory (relative to the working directory) where the stateline server will save its output. It will be created if it does not already exist.

`loggingRateSec`: The number of seconds between logging the state of the MCMC. Faster logging looks good in standard out, slower logging will save you disk space if you're redirecting to a file.

###C++ Example


The following code gives an close to minimal example of building a stateline
worker with a custom likelihood in C++.

```c++
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

#include "stateline/app/workerwrapper.hpp"
#include "stateline/app/signal.hpp"

int main()
{
  // This worker will evaluate any jobs with these indices
  // by specifying different indices for different workers they can specialise.
  std::pair jobIdRange = {0,10};

  // The address of the stateline server
  std::string address = "localhost:5000";

  // A stateline worker taking a likelihood function 'gaussianNLL'
  stateline::WorkerWrapper w(gaussianNLL, jobIdRange, address);

  // The worker itself runs in a different thread
  w.start();

  // By default the worker wrapper catches signals
  while(!stateline::global::interruptedBySignal)
  {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));
  }

  w.stop();
  return 0;
}
```

This code simply defines the job id range that the worker will evaluate,
the address of the server, then creates a `WorkerWrapper` object. This object
encapsulates all the communications systems with the server, including shaping,
heartbeating and detecting network errors. 

Once `start` is called


To see Stateline in action, open two terminals and run the following commands in a build directory:

Run the Stateline server in Terminal 1:

```bash
$ ./stateline --config=demo-config.json
```

Run a Stateline worker in Terminal 2:

```bash
$ ./demo-worker
```

###Python Example

There is also a demo in Python, which shows how workers written in other languages can interact with the Stateline server. This demo requires the [zmq] module (install via `pip  install zmq`). Again, open two terminals and run the following commands in a build directory (either `build/debug` or `build/release`):

Run the Stateline server in Terminal 1:

```bash
$ ./stateline --config=demo-config.json
```

Run a Stateline worker in Terminal 2:

```bash
$ python ./demo-worker.py
```

###Other Languages

For details of implementing workers for other languages, see [Workers in Other Languages](#workers-in-other-languages).


##Interpreting Logging
##MCMC Output

After running one of the above examples,  you should see a folder called `demo-output` in your build directory. This folder contains samples from the demo MCMC. Running

```bash
$ python vis.py demo-output/0.csv
```

will launch a Python script that visualises the samples of the first chain. You'll need NumPy and the excellent [corner-plot](https://github.com/dfm/corner.py) module (formerly triangle-plot).


Stateline outputs raw states in CSV format without removing any for burn-in or
decorrelation. The format of the csv is as follows

    sample_dim_1,sample_dim_2,...sample_dim_n, energy, sigma, beta, accepted,swap_type

where `energy` is the log-likelihood of the sample, `sigma` is the proposal
width at that time, `beta` is the temperature of the chain, `accepted` is a
boolean with 1 being an accept and 0 being reject, and `swap_type` is an
integer with 0 indicating no attempt was made to swap, 1 indicating a swap
occured, and 2 indicated a swap was attempted but was rejected.
